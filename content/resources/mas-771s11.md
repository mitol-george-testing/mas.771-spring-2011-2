description: "An autism-spectrum student uses a storytelling iPad\xAE app with Katie\
  \ Kelley, Speech Language Pathologist. This app, Toontastic, walks the student through\
  \ the steps of a good story, letting them narrate and animate the characters. They\
  \ adjust each scene\u2019s music for \"emotional energy level,\u201D and then the\
  \ app plays the story back so the student can hear their own voice. It can be used\
  \ for individual sessions, or in group work on collaboration as part of a social\
  \ skills program. (Photo courtesy of Amy Newton. Used with permission.)"
